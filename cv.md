### Briefly About Myself:
My work is not related to IT, it's more of a hobby for myself. 
I don't have much experience in creating and maintaining websites. 
But there is an understanding of Java Script, JQuery, Unix, Git, Node JS, Express JS, 
including making GET requests using Node HTTPS module, and SQL in combination with MongoDB.

### Skills:
* Java Script
* JQuery
* Node JS
* Three JS
* and the support framework 

### Code example:
```
(function(){
let result, yes = true, no = false

result = yes && yes
console.log('Are both true?' + result)

result = yes && no
console.log('Are both still true?' + result)
})()

```
